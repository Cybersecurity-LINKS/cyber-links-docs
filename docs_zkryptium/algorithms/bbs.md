# BBS+

The [BBS (Boneh-Boyen-Shacham) Signature Scheme](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures-07) is a cryptographic protocol optimized for efficient, privacy-preserving, multi-message signatures. The scheme is based on pairing-based cryptography, allowing a user to compactly sign multiple messages, with the possibility of verifying each individual message in a set without revealing the actual content. This makes BBS signatures well-suited for privacy-sensitive applications such as anonymous credentials and selective disclosures in identity systems.

Key characteristics of the BBS Signature Scheme:
- **Signature Compactness**: The BBS scheme can sign multiple messages in a compact format, producing a single signature that proves the authenticity of all messages in the set. This reduces data overhead in multi-message scenarios.
- **Selective Disclosure**: A unique feature of BBS signatures is their ability to selectively reveal certain signed messages while keeping others hidden. This functionality supports applications in privacy-preserving systems, such as Verifiable Credentials, where users may only need to disclose specific attributes of their identity.
- **Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: BBS signatures support efficient zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for verifying the validity of certain messages in a signature set without exposing additional information. This ZKP capability underpins its use in privacy-focused applications.

The BBS scheme employs asymmetric cryptographic operations and relies on pairings between groups in elliptic curve cryptography, which allows for compact and efficient operations.

### **Blind BBS Signature Extension**

The [Blind BBS Signature Extension](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-kalos-bbs-blind-signatures-01) builds on the BBS scheme to support blind signing, where a signer can authenticate a message without knowing its content. This is achieved through a blinding process applied to the message by the recipient before sending it to the signer. The signer then issues a signature over the blinded content, ensuring privacy.

Key features of the Blind BBS Signature Extension:
- **Message Blinding**: This extension allows recipients to obscure (blind) their messages before sending them to a signer. This process ensures that the signer cannot learn the message's content.

Together, the BBS Signature Scheme and its Blind Signature Extension offer a robust solution for privacy-preserving cryptographic systems, supporting applications in identity, authentication, and secure, anonymous transactions.
